Ink X is an online forum where tattoo artist can create profiles and display their work. Visitors on the site can idenfiy artists from whom they'd like to commission art.

At present, the site features create functionality for the artist model and delete functionality for the "pieces" model. Update routes have been written but are not yet imiplemented the project.

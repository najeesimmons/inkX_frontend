Ink X is an online forum where tattoo artist can create profiles and display their work. Visitors on the site can idenfiy artists from whom they'd like to commission art. 

This MERN Stack app began as a solo project as part of my 2022 Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Assembly. At present, the app fetches data from an API. This app relies on React Router Dom for Routing, useParams, useEffect and useState. 

My next steps will be:

- Adding user authentication and the ability to "favorite" artists an pieces. 
- At this time, on each artists show page, only a preview (5 pieces) of artwork are available. The API does containt many more pieces than this for most artists, however I am only accessing a collection of preview data which is an property of the artists model. In the future, I hope to decipher the params to the point where I can make a consistent, reliable fetch request for that data, give the user access to a larger sample size of tattoos.
